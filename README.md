Hi guys, Greetings of the day!

I am a Computer Science Senior at IIT Mandi. My name is Aakash Maurya and I hail from the Land of lord Rama, Ayodhya. My CSE background is covered with interesting projects and courses. 

I did a research project in landslide prediction and alert generation, where I could generate a journal paper and a conference paper.

Last Summer, I did my internship at Reqip, where I was asked to optimize the process of user timeline generation. More focused on the backend side and database handling, I could reduce the average time taken to generate all ticket activities for a single ticket id from 500 ms to under 50 ms. The task involved creating multiple APIs for the new timeline service and ensuring maximum coherency with the existing frontend service.

Currently, I, along with my college mate, are working in our free time on a deep learning research project on Semi-Supervised Video Action Segmentation.

I deeply value teamwork and like to take ownership in the task assigned to me. Therefore, I prefer to work in a rapid-growing environment and I take inspiration from the upcoming impact of my work.

My personality traits have a lot to do with my extra-curricular interests. I like sports and drama. In Sports, I play Cricket for my college, have won a medal in Inter-IIT sports for IIT Mandi. Last year, I served as the Sports Secretary of Student Gymkhana which is the highest student representative in sports for the college.

Thanks for reading about me.
